EX1
Part 1
This is a database of a parking lot. To use this program, user should follow the instructions and type in the correct information.Then an Arrival ticket or a departure ticket will appear.
The main function is responsible for collecting information and give these information to the corresponding function. In parking_lot.cpp, the class and structures are implemented. We used a class for the whole parking lot, and used structure for each parking space.

EX2----THE PARKING LOT DEMO---- VERSION: BETA 4.1
<THANKS IN ADVANCE>
BASIC INFORMATION:
1. As Suggested in the project manual, we define the class Vec and the operator of this class. This makes our life easier in the following step;
2. We define the class figure with colored figure and group as its sub-class. Rectangle and other basic figures are defined as sub-class in the class colored figure. UFO and other objects are defined as sub-class of group;
3. By adjust two Vec, postion and achor, we are able to define the method of the group;
4. Finally, with the use of variable flag, and rand(); we are able to accomplish the task;
5. We use timefunc to make it refresh 25 times per second;
<WAY TO PROVE>
1. We should try to use STL Vector to make it run better;
2. We could adjust the color to make it more beautiful;
3. Due to the time limit, we forget to add the gate of the parking lot, we will add it in the next version;
